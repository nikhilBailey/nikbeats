# Playlist Generator

This project uses a graph traversal algorithm to generate playlists of only songs I like. 
The algorithm ensures that each song flows smoothly and meets user criteria for a playlist.
Users can interact with my custom GUI, running off NextJS with Typescript to select the criteria for generating a playlist.
They can also modify several parameters of the generator under the advanced options.
